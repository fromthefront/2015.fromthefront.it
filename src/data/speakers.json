And if it is possible, is it a good idea?<br/><br/>But all this is a distraction from what could be a great talk on his favourite designs. Stuff he's seen and wants to talk about, perhaps other people might find it interesting too.It will be difficult not to mention the strangeness of Silbury Hill, the largest neolthic man made mound in Europe, the Sony Walkman, Wells Coates bakelite radio and Mellor's traffic lights. Or I'll think this this enterprise is hopeless and I'll try to tell a better story that embraces my distractions but champions more careful design thinking. ",

You can create much more complex and reliable layouts with flexbox than you can with floats, table display, or inline-block, all with far less CSS.<br/><br/>In this talk, you’ll learn which features of flexbox are particularly suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them today by applying flexbox as progressive enhancement. We’ll look at examples of responsive page components and patterns that you can enhance further by layering flexbox on top of other layout methods, ensuring all users get a good experience. ",
