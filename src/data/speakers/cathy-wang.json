  "talk-abstract": "We have always heard of the cliché phrase: “sex sells.” How do we design in a world that is intentionally and unintentionally powered by sexually-biased? <br><br> As designers, we are trained to look at the world around us with a curiosity and inquisition. If we take a design research approach to looking at gender, what will we find? <br><br> In this session, we will be taking a deeper look at how gender bias is embedded in the modern society.  We will explore different examples of gender prejudice and mental molds within the digital realm. Looking at different case studies of user experiences crafted with focuses on sex and gender. Discussing the definition for boundaries of sexism and vulgarity in different ux examples.",
