  "bio": "Andrew started designing and building sites on an agency treadmill then promoting user centered design to a reluctant banking behemoth before leaving to join a small design and research team building niche stuff for large audiences<br/><br/>After a couple of years at co-helming [Folksy](https://folksy.com/), the modern British craft marketplace, he now spends his days as a product owner trying to make the worldâ€™s leading accommodation platform better over at [Booking.com](http://booking.com).",
  "talk-abstract":"Andrew has recently found himself thinking about the architecture of cabins, the invention of radio, late 80s advertising in the UK, consumerism, why Elvis' reputation appears to be lost and the possibilities of inventing culture from design.<br/><br/>Is it possible, he wonders, to thread these scenes into a narrative about design principles? And if it is possible, is it a good idea?<br/><br/>But all this is a distraction from what could be a great talk on his favourite designs. Stuff he's seen and wants to talk about, perhaps other people might find it interesting too.It will be difficult not to mention the strangeness of Silbury Hill, the largest neolthic man made mound in Europe, the Sony Walkman, Wells Coates bakelite radio and Mellor's traffic lights. Or I'll think this this enterprise is hopeless and I'll try to tell a better story that embraces my distractions but champions more careful design thinking. ",
