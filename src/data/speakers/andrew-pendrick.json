  "bio": "Andrew started designing and building sites on an agency treadmill then promoting user centered design to a reluctant banking behemoth before leaving to join a small design and research team building niche stuff for large audiences<br/><br/>After a couple of years at co-helming [Folksy](https://folksy.com/), the modern British craft marketplace, he now spends his days as a product owner trying to make the world’s leading accommodation platform better over at [Booking.com](http://booking.com).",
  "talk-abstract":"Not knowing quite where to start or indeed how to end this talk, I've been thinking about our cognitive revolution, an ancient mound in South West England, the Walkman and bakelite radios, geodesic domes and sushi. Is it possible to thread these thoughts into a narrative that leads to a new design process? And if it is possible, is it a good idea?<br/><br/>Will this be relevant to you, your work or even this conference? Who can tell. Sometimes we have to start in the opposite direction to arrive at the end. I’ll throw in a few of my favourite product designs if the crowd gets restless.",
