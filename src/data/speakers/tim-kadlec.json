  "talk-title": "In Between",
  "talk-abstract": "Historically, the intermediary states of our sites have been neglected. The transition between the starting and ending points has been treated as an afterthought, one we begrudgingly fix because they’re there and they stick out like a sore thumb. But the web is maturing, and our roles are shifting as it does. Through careful choreography we can make sure that these intermediate states feel intentional. That they don’t break our users state of flow, but help to maintain it. The result will be more delightful experiences for our users—from start to finish and every step along the way."
