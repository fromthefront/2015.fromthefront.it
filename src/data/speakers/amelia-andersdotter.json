Since then, she is on the advisory group for the [Internet Governance Forum](http://www.intgovforum.org) at the United Nations.<br/><br/>She is also founder and director at [dataskydd.net](https://dataskydd.net/), and she has been involved in [copywrongs](http://copywrongs.eu/), a pan-European initiative to help citizens engage in the European Union copyright reform of 2015.",
  "talk-abstract": "The European Union is a geopolitically innovative construct, where differences are settled through end-less conversations and cooperation is inspired similarly. It's the ultimate expression of a “liberal world order”, where nation states are reduced to individual entities in the global landscape whose rights and responsiblities towards each other can be settled by negotiation. The political construct of the European Union, I argue, is similar to the technical construct of the Interet - mutual trust, innovation and camaraderie is expected to lead to good aims. Still we have security problems - for Europe, and for the Internet. They aren't always dealt with constructively, and the older the Union and the Internet get, the smaller is the focus on the individal citizens and persons who at the end constitute the nations, and the nodes and the networks. What should the EU do to make a better Internet? And what is it already doing? Where has it failed?",
