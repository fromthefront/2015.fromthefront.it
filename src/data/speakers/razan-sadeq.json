  "bio": "Razan is a user researcher at [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com). Razan’s goal is to get paid to have fun, and that's what she does today.<br/><br/>She's incredibly passionate and curious about understanding people and immersing herself in their wold. Why do they listen to music? How, when, what, who, why, why, why?! As she describes is, it's like playing detective.<br/><br/>Her previous gigs include working at [art+com](http://artcom.de/) in Berlin creating interactive installations, and hustling in the online fashion world where she specialised in user research.",
  "talk-abstract":"We’ve all been there - that moment when you, designers and researchers, are stumped and overwhelmed with hours of video, thousands of photos, artifacts, and documents. What should you do next? How do you do it? And how do you know when you've done a good job?<br/><br/>As with all detective work, design research is not a random search for clues; it is a structured, coherent and systematic process aiming to solve problems. In her talk, Razan will alternate between the detective hat and our UX hat as we take a look at the mindset, the skills, and the techniques we can learn from the greatest detective of them all - Sherlock Holmes.",
