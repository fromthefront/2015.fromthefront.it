  "bio": "Razan is a user researcher at [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com). Razanâ€™s goal is to get paid to have fun, and that's what she does today.<br/><br/>She's incredibly passionate and curious about understanding people and immersing herself in their wold. Why do they listen to music? How, when, what, who, why, why, why?! As she describes is, it's like playing detective.<br/><br/>Her previous gigs include working at [art+com](http://artcom.de/) in Berlin creating interactive installations, and hustling in the online fashion world where she specialised in user research.",
  "talk-abstract":"In web-based companies, User Research is often misunderstood for a usability test performed after developing the product, but it actually begins the moment we learn about a project, whether we acknowledge it or not.<br/><br/>In her talk, Razan will describe a set of investigative techniques used to add context and insight to the design process. Those techniques can be incorporated before, during, or after the design solution is established. The insights gained from research help us focus on the target audience needs and combat the natural tendency to design for ourselves, or our stakeholders.",
