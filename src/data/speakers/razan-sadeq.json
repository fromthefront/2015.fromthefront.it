  "bio": "Razan is a user researcher at [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com). Razan’s goal is to get paid to have fun, and that's what she does today.<br/><br/>She's incredibly passionate and curious about understanding people and immersing herself in their wold. Why do they listen to music? How, when, what, who, why, why, why?! As she describes is, it's like playing detective.<br/><br/>Her previous gigs include working at [art+com](http://artcom.de/) in Berlin creating interactive installations, and hustling in the online fashion world where she specialised in user research."
