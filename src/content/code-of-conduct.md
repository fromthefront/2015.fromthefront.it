##Code of conduct

From the Front strongly believes that is important for everyone to feel comfortable and therefore requires everyone involved in the conference to adhere to the [Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/).

But it's more than that.
The code of conduct is a shield to create harrassment-free environment, which is great, but if we stop there we miss a lot of opportunities: embracing diversity would give us the ability to grow as professional and people. 

**From the Front commits to offer a diverse and safe environment to enable everyone to benefit from living it.**
