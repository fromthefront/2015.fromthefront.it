##Code of conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at From the Front events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

From the Front is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, Twitter and other online media.

Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

This policy is inspired by the JSConf EU code of conduct.
